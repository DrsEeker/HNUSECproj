This small piece of software is made to save the design flaw of Dell XPS 2020 Laptop. Its function is to assign F9 key as the shortcut to turn on and off the laptop microphone.

The Dell XPS is branded as Dell's top line laptop and targets for business class people. However, the laptop's 2020 design cannot even properly facilitate teleconference. When someone wants to mute the microphone, he/she has to go through tons of clicks and locates the microphone controller in the deep hierarchy of the control panel. This is quite troublesome during a teleconference and may cause disasters...

So we decide to write this software. Lay users may just ignore the source code and download the .exe file. Double click and it works. It is a free and open source software so there is absolutely not even a bit of any guarantee that it will work and will not cause any undesirable consequence. Please take it as is. All I know is that it works on my Dell XPS 9500.
